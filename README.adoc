== Installation

Clone the repository:

[source,shell]
----
git clone git@github.com:constup/expressjs-sample-todo.git
----

Then start the Docker container

[source,shell]
----
docker compose up --build
----

=== Changing app port

The app uses port 3000 by default. If port 3000 is busy on your machine, you can use another port. To change the port:

- stop the container, if it's already running
- change the host port in `compose.yaml` (example: `"3004:3000"`)
- change the port in `BACKEND_URL` in link:html/js/main.js[main.js]
- run the container
